# Petri Dish

An open-source engine built in Godot 4 for exploring emergent behavior through procedural generation and genetic algorithms.

### Core Concepts

* **Procedural Anatomy:** Creatures are generated from a simple genetic code.
* **Physics-Based Animation:** Motion is driven by simulated physics and motors, leading to dynamic and responsive movement.
* **Emergent Locomotion:** Complex behaviors are not pre-programmed, but discovered through a process of simulated natural selection.

### Status

**Active Development:** The current focus is on building the core "3D Biomorph" generatorâ€”the system for creating static creature anatomy from a genome.
